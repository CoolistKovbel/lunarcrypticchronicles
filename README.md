# LunarCryptic Station

You ever felt stupid, not good enough, feel like you have so much potential but nobody wants to give you a head. Instead they look at you like a sick dog that needs to be put down...
hope you feel safe or at least welcomed here..

Welcome to my life...

Feel like i am workig i reverse...

catch you i guess i the heart just do breeak mine.

its like no matter how hard i try... its never good enoough, break my safety net watch me get back up, countinue breaking me down, watch me stress and hurt myself, but still pushing through, watch me die just to get this stupid freaking auth to freaking work. what the hell is life. can trust nobody. nothing. time wasted. life wasted. nothing seems better than a 6 foot whole with nothing but a rose on top of it.
